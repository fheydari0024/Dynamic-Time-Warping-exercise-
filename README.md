# Dynamic Time Warping - Speech Recognition Exercise

This repository contains a simple yet practical implementation of a speech recognition system using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm.  
The goal is to distinguish between two Persian words: **"ÿ®ŸÑŸá"** (Yes) and **"ÿÆ€åÿ±"** (No) through feature extraction and sequence alignment.

### üîç Key Features:
- Voice recording and preprocessing for each word
- Extraction of 16-dimensional cepstral feature vectors (300-sample frames)
- DTW-based alignment between test inputs and reference patterns
- Distance calculations using both Euclidean and Itakura metrics
- Final classification based on minimum distance

This project was developed as part of **Exercise 3** in the *Speech Recognition* course.
